*two's-complement* form is usually expressed as a function *B2Tw*, standing for 
"binary to two's complement", length *w*.

We can easily get some useful conclusions according to the picture above.

## Example 1: 2³¹ = -2³¹

```c
unsigned int a;
int b;

a = 2147483648;
b = (int)a;

printf("a = %u,  b = %d\n", a, b);
```
The output will be `a = 2147483648,  b = -2147483648`.

Because that:
> 2147483648 is (1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000)₂, 
> which turns into a signed integer will be (-1)\*2³¹, whose decimal form is -2147483648.

Actually, in c, when you input `-2³¹` to a int type variable i, then perform `i = -i`, 
i is still equal to `-2³¹`.

## Example 2: 2³² - 1 = -1

```c
unsigned int a;
int b;

a = 4294967295;
b = (int)a;

printf("a = %u,  b = %d\n", a, b);
```
The output will be `a = 4294967295,  b = -1`.

Because that:
> 4294967295 is (1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111)₂, 
> which turns into a signed integer will be (-1)\*2³¹ + 1\*2³⁰ + ... + 1\*2¹ + 1\*2⁰, which is the 
> largest negative integer, in other words, -1.

That's Amazing!
